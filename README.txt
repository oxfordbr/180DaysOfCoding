Welcome to my 180 Sites project. I got the idea from an Ars Technica article of another user doing something similar. For the next 180 days (business days) I will be creating a new website / webpage / feature every day. As I already have some skill in web programming I am not really using this as a "learn to code" thing so much as an "expand my skills" thing. Please feel welcome to follow along and add your comments on things that you feel I could improve on. I will be blogging about the project as I go along
